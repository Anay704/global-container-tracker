# 🌍 Global Container Tracker

**Track, filter, and analyze shipping containers across carriers in real-time.**

A modern web platform built to solve one of the most critical problems in global logistics: the **lack of centralized, cross-carrier visibility** for container shipments.

## 🚢 Problem We’re Solving

Manufacturers and logistics teams shipping internationally face:
- Fragmented tracking systems across Maersk, UPS, FedEx, Amazon Freight, etc.
- Limited visibility into in-transit vs delayed shipments
- No central dashboard for operational insights

**Global Container Tracker** solves this by offering:
- 📦 Unified tracking across carriers
- 🔍 Smart filtering by status, port, carrier
- 📊 Analytics dashboard for delay trends and port congestion
- 🧠 AI-adjusted ETAs based on carrier performance and congestion
